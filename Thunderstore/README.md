# Description

## Always return resources when destroying a building piece. Optionally include those disabled by the Valheim Devs. Limit this to only admin, if you want.

### Please note, this could override mods/mod configurations that have the recover resource option to false. Make sure you're okay with that.

`Version checks with itself. If installed on the server, it will kick clients who do not have it installed.`

`This mod uses ServerSync, if installed on the server and all clients, it will sync all configs to client`

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.`

### Admin = Single Player world owner or Dedicated Server Admin
